NAME
       scsiloop  -  Tool  for testing the PiSCSI board with a loopback adapter
       installed

SYNOPSIS
       scsiloop [-L LOG_LEVEL]

DESCRIPTION
       scsiloop Performs a self-test of the PiSCSI hardware to ensure that the
       board  is  functioning properly. In order for this tool to work, a spe‚Äê
       cial loopback cable MUST be attached to the PiSCSI SCSI connector.

       In addition to testing the GPIO signals, scsiloop will perform a  self-
       test  of  the  hardware timers that are built into the system on a chip
       (SoC).

       The loopback connections for the DB25 connector are shown here:

OPTIONS
       -L LOG_LEVEL
              The piscsi log level (trace, debug, info, warn, err,  off).  The
              default log level is 'info'.
