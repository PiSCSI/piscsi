NAME
       rasctl - Sends management commands to the rascsi process

SYNOPSIS
       rasctl -l | -s | [-g LOG_LEVEL] [-h HOST] [-p PORT] [-v] -i ID [-c CMD]
       [-f FILE] [-n NAME] [-t TYPE] [-u UNIT]

DESCRIPTION
       rasctl Sends commands to the rascsi process to make  configuration  ad‐
       justments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

       Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both.

       You do NOT need root privileges to use rasctl.

       Note:  The  command  and  type arguments are case insensitive. Only the
       first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.

OPTIONS
       -g LOG_LEVEL
              The rascsi log level to set  (trace,  debug,  info,  warn,  err,
              critical, off)

       -h HOST
              The rascsi host to connect to, default is 'localhost'.

       -l     List  all  of  the  devices that are currently being emulated by
              RaSCSI, as well as their current status.

       -p PORT
              The rascsi port to connect to, default is 6868.

       -s     Display the server-side configuration settings.

       -v     Display the rascsi version.

       -i ID  ID is the SCSI ID that you want to control. (0-7)

       -c CMD Command is the operation being requested. options are:
                 attach: attach disk
                 detach: detach disk
                 insert: insert media (Magneto-Optical and CD only)
                 eject:  eject media  (Magneto-Optical and CD only)
                 protect: Write protect the media (Magneto-Optical only)
                 unprotect: Remove write protection from the  media  (Magneto-
              Optical only)

              When the command is omitted, rasctl will default to the 'attach'
              command.

       -f FILE
              Path to the disk image file. See the rascsi(1) man page for  al‐
              lowable file types.

       -t TYPE
              Specifies  the type of disk. If this disagrees with the file ex‐
              tension of the specified image, the TYPE  argument  is  ignored.
              Available drive types are:
                 hd: Hard disk (SCSI or SASI)
                 rm: Removable hard disk (SCSI)
                 mo: Magneto-Optical disk
                 cd: CD-ROM
                 bridge:  Bridge  device (This is only applicable to the Sharp
              X68000)

       -u NAME
              The vendor, product and revision for the device, to be  returned
              with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be
              specified. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to  16,  REVISION
              up  to  4  characters.  Once  set the name of a device cannot be
              changed.

       -u UNIT
              Unit number (0 or 1). This will default to  0.  This  option  is
              only  used when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI
              controller. (This is not common)

EXAMPLES
       Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status.
          rasctl -l

       Example output:
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
          | ID | UN | TYPE | DEVICE STATUS
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
          |  0 |  1 | SCHD | /home/pi/harddisk.hda
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------

       Request the RaSCSI process to attach a disk (assumed) to SCSI ID 0 with
       the contents of the file system image "HDIIMAGE0.HDS".
          rasctl -i 0 -f HDIIMAGE0.HDS
