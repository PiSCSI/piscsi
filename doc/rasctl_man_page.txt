SYNOPSIS
       rasctl -e | -l | -m | -o | -s | -v | -D | -I | -L | -O | -P | -T | -V |
       -X | [-C FILENAME:FILESIZE] [-E FILENAME] [-F  IMAGE_FOLDER]  [-R  CUR‐
       RENT_NAME:NEW_NAME]  [-c  CMD] [-f FILE|PARAM] [-g LOG_LEVEL] [-h HOST]

DESCRIPTION
       rasctl  Sends  commands to the rascsi process to make configuration ad‐
       justments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

       Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both.

       You do NOT need root privileges to use rasctl.

       Note: The command and type arguments are  case  insensitive.  Only  the
       first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.

OPTIONS
       -C FILENAME:FILESIZE

              Copy an image file in the default image folder.

       -z LOCALE
              Overrides the default locale for client-facing error messages.

       -i ID  ID is the SCSI ID that you want to control. (0-7)

       -c CMD Command is the operation being requested. Options are:
                 a(ttach): Attach disk
                 d(etach): Detach disk
                 i(nsert): Insert media (removable media devices only)
                 e(ject): Eject media (removable media devices only)
                 p(rotect):  Write  protect the medium (not for CD-ROMs, which
              are always read-only)
                 u(nprotect): Remove write protection from the medium (not for
              CD-ROMs, which are always read-only)
                 s(how): Display device information

              eject, protect and unprotect are idempotent.

       -b BLOCK_SIZE
              The optional block size. For SCSI drives 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096
              bytes, default size is 512 bytes. For SASI drives  256  or  1024
              bytes, default is 256 bytes.

       -f FILE|PARAM
              Device-specific: Either a path to a disk image file, or a param‐
              eter for a non-disk device. See the rascsi(1) man page for  per‐
              mitted file types.

       -t TYPE
              Specifies  the device type. This type overrides the type derived
              from  the  file  extension  of  the  specified  image.  See  the
              rascsi(1)  man  page  for  the  available device types. For some
              types there are shortcuts (only the first letter is required):
                 hd: SCSI hard disk drive
                 rm: SCSI removable media drive
                 cd: CD-ROM
                 mo: Magneto-Optical disk
                 bridge: Bridge device (Only applicable to the Sharp X68000)
                 daynaport: DaynaPORT network adapter

       -n VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
              The vendor, product and revision for the device, to be  returned
              with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be
              provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, REVISION up
              to 4 characters. Padding with blanks to the maxium length is au‐
              tomatically applied. Once set the name of  a  device  cannot  be
              changed.

       -u UNIT
              Unit  number (0-31). This will default to 0. This option is only
              used when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI  con‐
              troller. (This is not common)

EXAMPLES
       Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status.
          rasctl -l

       Example output:
          +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------
          | ID | LUN | TYPE | IMAGE FILE
          +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------
          |  0 |   1 | SCHD | /home/pi/harddisk.hda
          +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------

       Request the RaSCSI process to attach a disk (assumed) to SCSI ID 0 with
       the contents of the file system image "HDIIMAGE0.HDS".
          rasctl -i 0 -f HDIIMAGE0.HDS
