       -X | [-C FILENAME:FILESIZE] [-E FILENAME] [-F  IMAGE_FOLDER]  [-R  CUR‐
       RENT_NAME:NEW_NAME]  [-c  CMD] [-f FILE|PARAM] [-g LOG_LEVEL] [-h HOST]

DESCRIPTION
       rasctl  Sends  commands to the rascsi process to make configuration ad‐
       justments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

       Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both.

       You do NOT need root privileges to use rasctl.

       Note: The command and type arguments are  case  insensitive.  Only  the
       first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.

                 d(etach): Detach disk
                 i(nsert): Insert media (removable media devices only)
                 e(ject): Eject media (removable media devices only)
                 p(rotect): Write protect the medium (not for  CD-ROMs,  which
              are always read-only)
                 u(nprotect): Remove write protection from the medium (not for
              CD-ROMs, which are always read-only)
                 s(how): Display device information

              eject, protect and unprotect are idempotent.

       -b BLOCK_SIZE
              The optional block size, either 512, 1024, 2048 or  4096  bytes.

       -f FILE|PARAM
              Device-specific: Either a path to a disk image file, or a param‐

              mitted file types.

       -t TYPE
              Specifies  the device type. This type overrides the type derived
              from  the  file  extension  of  the  specified  image.  See  the
              rascsi(1)  man  page  for  the  available device types. For some
              types there are shortcuts (only the first letter is required):
                 hd: SCSI hard disk drive
                 rm: SCSI removable media drive
                 cd: CD-ROM
                 mo: Magneto-Optical disk
                 lp: SCSI printer
                 bridge: Bridge device (Only applicable to the Sharp X68000)
                 daynaport: DaynaPort network adapter
                 services: Host services device

       -n VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
              The vendor, product and revision for the device, to be  returned
              with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be
              provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, REVISION up
              to 4 characters. Padding with blanks to the maxium length is au‐
              tomatically applied. Once set the name of  a  device  cannot  be
              changed.

       -u UNIT
              Unit  number (0-31). This will default to 0. This option is only
              used when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI  con‐
              troller. (This is not common)

EXAMPLES
       Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status.
          rasctl -l

       Example output:
          +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------
          | ID | LUN | TYPE | IMAGE FILE
          +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------
          |  0 |   1 | SCHD | /home/pi/harddisk.hda
          +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------

       Request the RaSCSI process to attach a disk (assumed) to SCSI ID 0 with
       the contents of the file system image "HDIIMAGE0.HDS".
          rasctl -i 0 -f HDIIMAGE0.HDS
