NAME
       rasctl - Sends management commands to the rascsi process

SYNOPSIS
       rasctl -l | -s | [-g LOG_LEVEL] [-h HOST] [-p PORT] [-r IDS] [-v] -i ID
       [-c CMD] [-f FILE] [-n NAME] [-t TYPE] [-u UNIT]

DESCRIPTION
       rasctl Sends commands to the rascsi process to make  configuration  ad‐
       justments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

       Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both.

       You do NOT need root privileges to use rasctl.

       Note:  The  command  and  type arguments are case insensitive. Only the
       first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.

OPTIONS
       -g LOG_LEVEL
              The rascsi log level to set  (trace,  debug,  info,  warn,  err,
              critical, off)

       -h HOST
              The rascsi host to connect to, default is 'localhost'.

       -l     List  all  of  the  devices that are currently being emulated by
              RaSCSI, as well as their current status.

       -p PORT
              The rascsi port to connect to, default is 6868.

       -r IDS Comma-separated list of IDs to reserve.

       -s     Display server-side settings like available images or  supported
              device types.

       -v     Display the rascsi version.

       -i ID  ID is the SCSI ID that you want to control. (0-7)

       -c CMD Command is the operation being requested. Options are:
                 a(ttach): Attach disk
                 d(etach): Detach disk
                 i(nsert): Insert media (removable media devices only)
                 e(ject): Eject media (removable media devices only)
                 p(rotect):  Write  protect the medium (not for CD-ROMs, which
              are always read-only)
                 u(nprotect): Remove write protection from the medium (not for
              CD-ROMs, which are always read-only)
                 s(how): Display device information

              eject, protect and unprotect are idempotent.

       -b BLOCK_SIZE
              The optional block size. For SCSI drives 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096
              bytes, default size is 512 bytes. For SASI drives  256  or  1024
              bytes, default is 256 bytes.

       -f FILE
              Path  to the disk image file. See the rascsi(1) man page for al‐
              lowable file types.

       -t TYPE
              Specifies the device type. This type overrides the type  derived
              from  the  file  extension  of  the  specified  image.  See  the
              rascsi(1) man page for the  available  device  types.  For  some
              types there are shortcuts (only the first letter is required):
                 hd: SCSI hard disk drive
                 rm: SCSI removable media drive
                 cd: CD-ROM
                 mo: Magneto-Optical disk
                 bridge: Bridge device (Only applicable to the Sharp X68000)
                 daynaport: Daynaport network adapter

       -u VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
              The  vendor, product and revision for the device, to be returned
              with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be
              provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, REVISION up
              to 4 characters. Padding with blanks to the maxium length is au‐
              tomatically  applied.  Once  set  the name of a device cannot be
              changed.

       -u UNIT
              Unit number (0 or 1). This will default to  0.  This  option  is
              only  used when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI
              controller. (This is not common)

EXAMPLES
       Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status.
          rasctl -l

       Example output:
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
          | ID | UN | TYPE | DEVICE STATUS
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
          |  0 |  1 | SCHD | /home/pi/harddisk.hda
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------

       Request the RaSCSI process to attach a disk (assumed) to SCSI ID 0 with
       the contents of the file system image "HDIIMAGE0.HDS".
          rasctl -i 0 -f HDIIMAGE0.HDS
