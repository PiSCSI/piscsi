NAME
       rasctl - Sends management commands to the rascsi process

SYNOPSIS
       rasctl -l | -i ID [-u UNIT] [-c CMD] [-t TYPE] [-f FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       rasctl Sends commands to the rascsi process to make configuration adjustments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

       Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both.

       You do NOT need root privileges to use rasctl.

       Note: The command and type arguments are case insensitive. Only the first letter of the command/type are evaluated by the tool.

OPTIONS
       -l     List all of the devices that are currently being emulated by RaSCSI, as well as their current status.

       -i ID  ID is the SCSI ID that you want to control. (0-7)

       -u UNIT
              Unit number (0 or 1). This will default to 0. This option is only used when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI controller. (This is not common)

       -c CMD Command is the operation being requested. options are:
                 attach: attach disk
                 detach: detach disk
                 insert: insert media (Magneto-Optical and CD only)
                 eject:  eject media  (Magneto-Optical and CD only)
                 protect: Write protect the media (Magneto-Optical only)

              When the command is omited, rasctl will default to the 'attach' command

       -t TYPE
              Specifies the type of disk. If this disagrees with the file extension of the specified image, the TYPE argument is ignored. Available drive types are:
                 hd: Hard disk (SCSI or SASI)
                 mo: Magneto-Optical disk)
                 cd: CD-ROM
                 bridge: Bridge device (This is only applicable to the Sharp X68000)

       -f FILE
              Path to the disk image file. See the rascsi(1) man page for allowable file types.

EXAMPLES
       Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status
          rasctl -l

       Example output:
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
          | ID | UN | TYPE | DEVICE STATUS
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
          |  0 |  1 | SCHD | /home/pi/harddisk.hda
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------

       Request the RaSCSI process to attach a disk (assumed) to SCSI ID 0 with the contents of the file system image "HDIIMAGE0.HDS".
          rasctl -i 0 -f HDIIMAGE0.HDS
