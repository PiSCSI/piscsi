NAME
       rasctl - Sends management commands to the rascsi process

SYNOPSIS
       rasctl -l | -s | [-g LOG_LEVEL] [-h HOST] [-p PORT] [-v] -i ID [-c CMD]
       [-f FILE] [-n NAME] [-t TYPE] [-u UNIT]

DESCRIPTION
       rasctl Sends commands to the rascsi process to make  configuration  ad‐
       justments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

       Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both.

       You do NOT need root privileges to use rasctl.

       Note:  The  command  and  type arguments are case insensitive. Only the
       first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.

OPTIONS
       -g LOG_LEVEL
              The rascsi log level to set  (trace,  debug,  info,  warn,  err,
              critical, off)

       -h HOST
              The rascsi host to connect to, default is 'localhost'.

       -l     List  all  of  the  devices that are currently being emulated by
              RaSCSI, as well as their current status.

       -p PORT
              The rascsi port to connect to, default is 6868.

       -s     Display the server-side configuration settings.

       -v     Display the rascsi version.

       -i ID  ID is the SCSI ID that you want to control. (0-7)

       -c CMD Command is the operation being requested. options are:
                 attach: attach disk
                 detach: detach disk
                 insert: insert media (removable media devices only)
                 eject: eject media (removable media devices only)
                 protect: write protect the media (not for CD-ROMs, which  are
              always read-only)
                 unprotect:  remove  write  protection from the media (not for
              CD-ROMs, which are always read-only)

              eject, protect and unprotect are idempotent.

       -f FILE
              Path to the disk image file. See the rascsi(1) man page for  al‐
              lowable file types.

       -t TYPE
              Specifies  the device type. This type overrides the type derived
              from  the  file  extension  of  the  specified  image.  See  the
              rascsi(1)  man page for the available device types. Legacy drive
              types are:
                 hd: Hard disk (SCSI or SASI)
                 mo: Magneto-Optical disk
                 cd: CD-ROM
                 bridge: Bridge device (This is only applicable to  the  Sharp
              X68000)

       -u VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
              The  vendor, product and revision for the device, to be returned
              with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be
              provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, REVISION up
              to 4 characters. Padding with blanks to the maxium length is au‐
              tomatically  applied.  Once  set  the name of a device cannot be
              changed.

       -u UNIT
              Unit number (0 or 1). This will default to  0.  This  option  is
              only  used when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI
              controller. (This is not common)

EXAMPLES
       Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status.
          rasctl -l

       Example output:
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
          | ID | UN | TYPE | DEVICE STATUS
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
          |  0 |  1 | SCHD | /home/pi/harddisk.hda
          +----+----+------+-------------------------------------

       Request the RaSCSI process to attach a disk (assumed) to SCSI ID 0 with
       the contents of the file system image "HDIIMAGE0.HDS".
          rasctl -i 0 -f HDIIMAGE0.HDS
