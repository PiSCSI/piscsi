.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scsimon
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scsimon
monitors all of the traffic on the SCSI bus, using a PiSCSI device. The data is cached in memory while the tool is running. A circular buffer is used so that only the most recent 1,000,000 transactions are stored. The tool will continue to run until the user presses CTRL-C, or the process receives a SIGINT signal.
.PP
The logged data is stored in a file called "log.vcd" in the current working directory from where scsimon was launched.

Currently, scsimon doesn't accept any arguments.

To quit scsimon, press Control + C.

.SH EXAMPLES
Make sure you've stopped the piscsi service. Then launch scsimon to capture all SCSI traffic available to the PiSCSI hardware:
   scsimon

If you're trying to capture a specific scenario, you'll want to wait to start scsimon until immediately before the scenario.
