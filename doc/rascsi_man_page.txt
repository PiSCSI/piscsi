NAME
       rascsi - Emulates SCSI devices using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins

SYNOPSIS
       rascsi  [-f[u00AE]  FOLDER] [-g[u00AE] LOG_LEVEL] [-h] [-p[u00AE] PORT]
       [-v] [-IDn FILE] [-HDn FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       rascsi Emulates SCSI devices using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

       In the arguments to RaSCSI, one or more SCSI (-IDn) or SASI (-HDn)  de‐
       vices  can  be specified.  The number (n) after the ID or HD identifier
       specifies the ID number for that device.  For SCSI: The ID  is  limited
       from  0-7. However, typically SCSI ID 7 is reserved for the "initiator"
       (the host computer). Note that SASI is considered rare and only used on
       very early Sharp X68000 computers.

       RaSCSI  will determine the type of device based upon the file extension
       of the FILE argument.
           hdf: SASI Hard Disk image (XM6 SASI HD image - typically only  used
       with X68000)
           hds: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable)
           hdr: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, removable)
           hdn: SCSI Hard Disk image (NEC GENUINE)
           hdi: SCSI Hard Disk image (Anex86 HD image)
           nhd: SCSI Hard Disk image (T98Next HD image)
           hda:  SCSI Hard Disk image (APPLE GENUINE - typically used with Mac
       SCSI emulation)
           mos: SCSI Magneto-optical image (XM6 SCSI MO image - typically only
       used with X68000)
           iso: SCSI CD-ROM image (ISO 9660 image)

       For  example, if you want to specify an Apple-compatible HD image on ID
       0, you can use the following command:
           sudo rascsi -ID0 /path/to/drive/hdimage.hda

       Once RaSCSI starts, it will open a socket (default port is 6868) to al‐
       low  external  management  commands.   If  another process is using the
       rascsi port, RaSCSI will terminate, since it is likely another instance
       of RaSCSI.  Once RaSCSI has initialized, the rasctl utility can be used
       to send commands.

       To quit RaSCSI, press Control + C. If it is running in the  background,
       you can kill it using an INT signal.

OPTIONS
       -f FOLDER
              The  default folder for image files. For files in this folder no
              absolute path needs to  be  specified.  The  default  folder  is
              '~/images'.

       -g LOG_LEVEL
              The  rascsi  log level (trace, debug, info, warn, err, critical,
              off). The default log level is 'trace'.

       -h     Show a help page.

       -p PORT
              The rascsi server port, default is 6868.

       -v     Display the rascsi version.

       -IDn FILE[:TYPE]
              n is the SCSI ID number (0-7)

              FILE is the name of the image file to attach to that ID. An  op‐
              tional  explicit case-insensitive device type (SAHD, SCHD, SCRM,
              SCCD, SCMO, SCBR, SCDP) can be provided after a colon.  For  de‐
              vices  without  image  file  support (SCBR, SCDP) FILE may start
              with a colon.

       -HDn FILE
              n is the SASI ID number (0-15)

              FILE is the name of the image file to attach to that ID. If FILE
              starts  with  '/dev/'  the  extension,  which encodes the device
              type, is stripped, so that device files can conveniently be used
              as image files.

              Note:  SASI  usage  is  rare,  and is typically limited to early
              Sharp X68000 systems.

EXAMPLES
       Launch RaSCSI with no emulated drives attached:
          rascsi

       Launch RaSCSI with an Apple hard drive image as ID 0 and a CD-ROM as ID
       2
          rascsi -ID0 /path/to/harddrive.hda -ID2 /path/to/cdimage.iso

       Launch RaSCSI with a removable SCSI drive image as ID 0 and the raw de‐
       vice file /dev/hdb (e.g. a USB stick):
          rascsi -ID0 /dev/hdb:scrm

       To create an empty, 100MB HD image, use the following command:
          dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/newimage.hda bs=512 count=204800

       In case the fallocate command is available a much faster alternative to
       the dd command is:
          fallocate -l 104857600 /path/to/newimage.hda
