DESCRIPTION
       rascsi Emulates SCSI devices using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

       In the arguments to  RaSCSI,  one  or  more  SCSI  (-IDn[:u])  or  SASI
       (-HDn[:u]) devices can be specified.  The number (n) after the ID or HD
       identifier specifies the ID number for that device. The optional number
       (u)  specifies  the LUN (logical unit) for that device. The default LUN
       is 0.  For SCSI: The ID is limited from 0-7. However, typically SCSI ID
       7  is reserved for the "initiator" (the host computer). The LUN is lim‐
       ited from 0-31. Note that SASI is considered rare and only used on very
       early Sharp X68000 computers.

       RaSCSI  will determine the type of device based upon the file extension
       of the FILE argument.
           hdf: SASI Hard Disk image (XM6 SASI HD image - typically only  used
       with X68000)
           hds: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable)
           hdr: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, removable)
           hdn: SCSI Hard Disk image (NEC GENUINE)
           hdi: SCSI Hard Disk image (Anex86 HD image)
           nhd: SCSI Hard Disk image (T98Next HD image)
           hda:  SCSI Hard Disk image (APPLE GENUINE - typically used with Mac
       SCSI emulation)
           mos: SCSI Magneto-optical image (XM6 SCSI MO image - typically only
       used with X68000)
           iso: SCSI CD-ROM image (ISO 9660 image)

       For  example, if you want to specify an Apple-compatible HD image on ID
       0, you can use the following command:
           sudo rascsi -ID0 /path/to/drive/hdimage.hda

       Once RaSCSI starts, it will open a socket (default port is 6868) to al‐
       low  external  management  commands.   If  another process is using the
       rascsi port, RaSCSI will terminate, since it is likely another instance
       of RaSCSI.  Once RaSCSI has initialized, the rasctl utility can be used
       to send commands.

       To quit RaSCSI, press Control + C. If it is running in the  background,
       you can kill it using an INT signal.

OPTIONS
       -b BLOCK_SIZE
              The optional block size. For SCSI drives 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096
              bytes, default size is 512 bytes. For SASI drives  256  or  1024
              bytes, default is 256 bytes.

       -F FOLDER
              The  default folder for image files. For files in this folder no
              absolute path needs to be specified. The initial default  folder
              is '~/images'.

       -L LOG_LEVEL
              The  rascsi  log level (trace, debug, info, warn, err, critical,
              off). The default log level is 'info'.

       -P ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE
              Enable authentication and read the access token from the  speci‐
              fied  file. The access token file must be owned by root and must
              be readable by root only.

       -R SCAN_DEPTH
              Scan for image files recursively, up to a depth  of  SCAN_DEPTH.
              Depth  0  means  to  ignore any folders within the default image
              filder. Be careful when using this option with many  sub-folders
              in the default image folder. The default depth is 1.

       -h     Show a help page.

       -n VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
              Set  the  vendor, product and revision for the device, to be re‐
              turned with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name  components
              must be provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, RE‐
              VISION up to 4 characters. Padding with  blanks  to  the  maxium
              length  is  automatically applied. Once set the name of a device
              cannot be changed.

       -p PORT
              The rascsi server port, default is 6868.

       -r RESERVED_IDS
              Comma-separated list of IDs to reserve.  -p  TYPE  The  optional
              case-insensitive  device  type  (SAHD,  SCHD,  SCRM, SCCD, SCMO,
              SCBR, SCDP). If no type is specified for devices that support an
              image file, rascsi tries to derive the type from the file exten‐
              sion.

       -v     Display the rascsi version.

       -z LOCALE
              Overrides the default locale for  client-faces  error  messages.
              The client can override the locale.

       -IDn[:u] FILE
              n  is  the  SCSI  ID  number (0-7). u (0-31) is the optional LUN
              (logical unit). The default LUN is 0.

              FILE is the name of the image file to use for the  SCSI  device.
              For  devices  that  do  not support an image file (SCBR, SCDP) a
              dummy name must be provided.

       -HDn[:u] FILE
              n is the SASI ID number (0-15). The effective SASI ID is  calcu‐
              lated  as  n/2,  the effective SASI LUN is calculated is the re‐
              mainder of n/2. Alternatively the n:u syntax can be used,  where
              ns is the SASI ID (0-7) and u the LUN (0-1).

              FILE is the name of the image file to use for the SASI device.

              Note: SASI usage is rare, and is typically limited to early Unix
              workstations and Sharp X68000 systems.

EXAMPLES
       Launch RaSCSI with no emulated drives attached:
          rascsi

       Launch RaSCSI with an Apple hard drive image as ID 0 and a CD-ROM as ID
       2
          rascsi -ID0 /path/to/harddrive.hda -ID2 /path/to/cdimage.iso

       Launch RaSCSI with a removable SCSI drive image as ID 0 and the raw de‐
       vice file /dev/hdb (e.g. a USB stick) and a DaynaPort  network  adapter
       as ID 6:
          rascsi -ID0 -t scrm /dev/hdb -ID6 -t scdp DUMMY_FILENAME

       To create an empty, 100MB HD image, use the following command:
          dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/newimage.hda bs=512 count=204800

       In case the fallocate command is available a much faster alternative to
       the dd command is:
          fallocate -l 104857600 /path/to/newimage.hda
