DESCRIPTION
       rascsi Emulates SCSI devices using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

       In the arguments to RaSCSI, one or more SCSI (-IDn[:u]) devices can  be
       specified.   The number (n) after the ID or HD identifier specifies the
       ID number for that device. The optional number (u)  specifies  the  LUN
       (logical unit) for that device. The default LUN is 0.  For SCSI: The ID
       is limited from 0-7. However, typically SCSI ID 7 is reserved  for  the
       "initiator" (the host computer). The LUN is limited from 0-31.

       RaSCSI  will determine the type of device based upon the file extension
       of the FILE argument.
           hd1: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable, SCSI-1)
           hds: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable)
           hdr: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, removable)
           hdn: SCSI Hard Disk image (NEC GENUINE)
           hdi: SCSI Hard Disk image (Anex86 HD image)
           nhd: SCSI Hard Disk image (T98Next HD image)
           hda: SCSI Hard Disk image (APPLE GENUINE - typically used with  Mac
       SCSI emulation)
           mos: SCSI Magneto-optical image (XM6 SCSI MO image - typically only
       used with X68000)
           iso: SCSI CD-ROM image (ISO 9660 image)

       For example, if you want to specify an Apple-compatible HD image on  ID
       0, you can use the following command:
           sudo rascsi -ID0 /path/to/drive/hdimage.hda

       Once RaSCSI starts, it will open a socket (default port is 6868) to al‐
       low external management commands.  If  another  process  is  using  the
       rascsi port, RaSCSI will terminate, since it is likely another instance
       of RaSCSI.  Once RaSCSI has initialized, the rasctl utility can be used
       to send commands.

       To  quit RaSCSI, press Control + C. If it is running in the background,
       you can kill it using an INT signal.

OPTIONS
       -b BLOCK_SIZE
              The optional block size, either 512, 1024, 2048 or  4096  bytes.
              Default size is 512 bytes.

       -F FOLDER
              The  default folder for image files. For files in this folder no
              absolute path needs to be specified. The initial default  folder
              is '~/images'.

       -L LOG_LEVEL
              The  rascsi  log level (trace, debug, info, warn, err, critical,
              off). The default log level is 'info'.

       -P ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE
              Enable authentication and read the access token from the  speci‐
              fied  file. The access token file must be owned by root and must
              be readable by root only.

       -R SCAN_DEPTH
              Scan for image files recursively, up to a depth  of  SCAN_DEPTH.
              Depth  0  means  to  ignore any folders within the default image
              filder. Be careful when using this option with many  sub-folders
              in the default image folder. The default depth is 1.

       -h     Show a help page.

       -n VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
              Set  the  vendor, product and revision for the device, to be re‐
              turned with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name  components
              must be provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, RE‐
              VISION up to 4 characters. Padding with  blanks  to  the  maxium
              length  is  automatically applied. Once set the name of a device
              cannot be changed.

       -p PORT
              The rascsi server port, default is 6868.

       -r RESERVED_IDS
              Comma-separated list of IDs to reserve. Pass an  empty  list  in
              order to not reserve anything.  -p TYPE The optional case-insen‐
              sitive device type (SAHD, SCHD, SCRM, SCCD,  SCMO,  SCBR,  SCDP,
              SCLP, SCHS). If no type is specified for devices that support an
              image file, rascsi tries to derive the type from the file exten‐
              sion.

       -v     Display the rascsi version.

       -z LOCALE
              Overrides  the  default  locale for client-faces error messages.
              The client can override the locale.

       -IDn[:u] FILE
              n is the SCSI ID number (0-7). u  (0-31)  is  the  optional  LUN
              (logical unit). The default LUN is 0.

              FILE  is  the name of the image file to use for the SCSI device.
              For devices that do not support an image file (SCBR, SCDP, SCLP,
              SCHS)  the  filename  may have a special meaning or a dummy name
              can be provided. For SCBR and SCDP it is  an  optioinal  priori‐
              tized  list  of  network  interfaces, an optional IP address and
              netmask,  e.g.  "interfaces=eth0,eth1,wlan0:inet=10.10.20.1/24".
              For  SCLP  it  is the print command to be used and a reservation
              timeout in seconds, e.g. "cmd=lp -oraw %f:timeout=60".

              FILE is the name of the image file to use for the SCSI device.

EXAMPLES
       Launch RaSCSI with no emulated drives attached:
          rascsi

       Launch RaSCSI with an Apple hard drive image as ID 0 and a CD-ROM as ID
       2
          rascsi -ID0 /path/to/harddrive.hda -ID2 /path/to/cdimage.iso

       Launch RaSCSI with a removable SCSI drive image as ID 0 and the raw de‐
       vice file /dev/hdb (e.g. a USB stick) and a DaynaPort  network  adapter
       as ID 6:
          rascsi -ID0 -t scrm /dev/hdb -ID6 -t scdp daynaport

       To create an empty, 100MiB HD image, use the following command:
          dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/newimage.hda bs=512 count=204800

       In case the fallocate command is available a much faster alternative to
       the dd command is:
          fallocate -l 104857600 /path/to/newimage.hda
