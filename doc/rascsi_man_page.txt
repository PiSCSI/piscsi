NAME
       rascsi - Emulates SCSI devices using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins

SYNOPSIS
       rascsi  [-f[u00AE]  FOLDER] [-g[u00AE] LOG_LEVEL] [-h] [-n VENDOR:PROD‐
       UCT:REVISION]  [-p[u00AE]  PORT]  [-n  TYPE]  [-v]  [-IDn  FILE]  [-HDn
       FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       rascsi Emulates SCSI devices using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

       In  the arguments to RaSCSI, one or more SCSI (-IDn) or SASI (-HDn) de‐
       vices can be specified.  The number (n) after the ID or  HD  identifier
       specifies  the  ID number for that device.  For SCSI: The ID is limited
       from 0-7. However, typically SCSI ID 7 is reserved for the  "initiator"
       (the host computer). Note that SASI is considered rare and only used on
       very early Sharp X68000 computers.

       RaSCSI will determine the type of device based upon the file  extension
       of the FILE argument.
           hdf:  SASI Hard Disk image (XM6 SASI HD image - typically only used
       with X68000)
           hds: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable)
           hdr: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, removable)
           hdn: SCSI Hard Disk image (NEC GENUINE)
           hdi: SCSI Hard Disk image (Anex86 HD image)
           nhd: SCSI Hard Disk image (T98Next HD image)
           hda: SCSI Hard Disk image (APPLE GENUINE - typically used with  Mac
       SCSI emulation)
           mos: SCSI Magneto-optical image (XM6 SCSI MO image - typically only
       used with X68000)
           iso: SCSI CD-ROM image (ISO 9660 image)

       For example, if you want to specify an Apple-compatible HD image on  ID
       0, you can use the following command:
           sudo rascsi -ID0 /path/to/drive/hdimage.hda

       Once RaSCSI starts, it will open a socket (default port is 6868) to al‐
       low external management commands.  If  another  process  is  using  the
       rascsi port, RaSCSI will terminate, since it is likely another instance
       of RaSCSI.  Once RaSCSI has initialized, the rasctl utility can be used
       to send commands.

       To  quit RaSCSI, press Control + C. If it is running in the background,
       you can kill it using an INT signal.

OPTIONS
       -f FOLDER
              The default folder for image files. For files in this folder  no
              absolute  path needs to be specified. The initial default folder
              is '~/images'.

       -g LOG_LEVEL
              The rascsi log level (trace, debug, info, warn,  err,  critical,
              off). The default log level is 'info'.

       -h     Show a help page.

       -n VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
              Set  the  vendor, product and revision for the device, to be re‐
              turned with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name  components
              must be provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, RE‐
              VISION up to 4 characters. Padding with  blanks  to  the  maxium
              length  is  automatically applied. Once set the name of a device
              cannot be changed.

       -p PORT
              The rascsi server port, default is 6868.

       -p TYPE
              The optional case-insensitive device  type  (SAHD,  SCHD,  SCRM,
              SCCD,  SCMO,  SCBR,  SCDP).  If no type is specified for devices
              that support an image file, rascsi tries to derive the type from
              the file extension.

       -v     Display the rascsi version.

       -IDn FILE
              n is the SCSI ID number (0-7)

              FILE  is  the name of the image file to use for the SCSI device.
              For devices that do not support an image  file  (SCBR,  SCDP)  a
              dummy name must be provided.

       -HDn FILE
              n is the SASI ID number (0-15)

              FILE is the name of the image file to use for the SASI device.

              Note:  SASI  usage  is  rare,  and is typically limited to early
              Sharp X68000 systems.

EXAMPLES
       Launch RaSCSI with no emulated drives attached:
          rascsi

       Launch RaSCSI with an Apple hard drive image as ID 0 and a CD-ROM as ID
       2
          rascsi -ID0 /path/to/harddrive.hda -ID2 /path/to/cdimage.iso

       Launch RaSCSI with a removable SCSI drive image as ID 0 and the raw de‐
       vice file /dev/hdb (e.g. a USB stick) and a DaynaPort  network  adapter
       as ID 6:
          rascsi -ID0 -t scrm /dev/hdb -ID6 -t scdp DUMMY_FILENAME

       To create an empty, 100MB HD image, use the following command:
          dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/newimage.hda bs=512 count=204800

       In case the fallocate command is available a much faster alternative to
       the dd command is:
          fallocate -l 104857600 /path/to/newimage.hda
