NAME
       scsimon  —  Acts as a data capture tool for all traffic on the SCSI bus.
       Data is stored in a Value Change Dump (VCD) file.

SYNOPSIS
       scsimon [-i input_file_json] [-b buffer_size] [output_file]

DESCRIPTION
       scsimon monitors all of the traffic on the SCSI bus, using a PiSCSI  de‐
       vice. The data is cached in memory while the tool is running. A circular
       buffer  is  used  so  that only the most recent transactions are stored,
       with a default size of 1,000,000 unless overridden by the -b option. The
       tool will continue to run until the user presses CTRL-C, or the  process
       receives a SIGINT signal.

       If the -i option is specified, scsimon will parse the provided JSON file
       instead  of  capturing  new data. If -i option is not specified, scsimon
       will read the GPIO pins.

       The logged data is stored in files with the base name specified by  out‐
       put_file,  or  "log"  if  not  specified. The appropriate file extension
       (e.g., .json or .vcd) will be appended.

       To quit scsimon, press Control + C.

OPTIONS
       -i input_file_json scsimon will parse the json file instead of capturing
       new data. If -i option is not specified,  scsimon  will  read  the  gpio
       pins.   -b  buffer_size  Override  the  default  buffer size of 1000000.
       output_file Base name of the  output  files.  The  file  extension  (ex:
       .json) will be appended to this file name.

EXAMPLES
       Make sure you've stopped the piscsi service. Then launch scsimon to cap‐
       ture all SCSI traffic available to the PiSCSI hardware:
             scsimon

       If  you're trying to capture a specific scenario, you'll want to wait to
       start scsimon until immediately before the scenario.
