NAME
       scsimon - Acts as a data capture tool for all traffic on the SCSI bus. Data is stored in a Value Change Dump (VCD) file.

SYNOPSIS
       scsimon

DESCRIPTION
       scsimon  Monitors  all of the traffic on the SCSI bus, using a RaSCSI device. The data is cached in memory while the tool is running. A circular buffer is used so that only the most recent 1,000,000
       transactions are stored. The tool will continue to run until the user presses CTRL-C, or the process receives a SIGINT signal.

       The logged data is stored in a file called "log.vcd" in the current working directory from where scsimon was launched.

       Currently, scsimon doesn't accept any agruments.

       To quit scsimon, press Control + C.

OPTIONS
       None
