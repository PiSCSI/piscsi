scsimon(1)                  General Commands Manual                 scsimon(1)

NAME
       scsimon  - Acts as a data capture tool for all traffic on the SCSI bus.
       Data is stored in a Value Change Dump (VCD) file.

SYNOPSIS
       scsimon

DESCRIPTION
       scsimon Monitors all of the traffic on the SCSI bus, using a RaSCSI de‐
       vice.  The data is cached in memory while the tool is running. A circu‐
       lar buffer is used so that only the most recent 1,000,000  transactions
       are  stored. The tool will continue to run until the user presses CTRL-
       C, or the process receives a SIGINT signal.

       The logged data is stored in a file called  "log.vcd"  in  the  current
       working directory from where scsimon was launched.

       Currently, scsimon doesn't accept any arguments.

       To quit scsimon, press Control + C.

OPTIONS
       None

EXAMPLES
       Launch  scsimon  to  capture  all  SCSI traffic available to the RaSCSI
       hardware:
          scsimon
