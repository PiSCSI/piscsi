DESCRIPTION
       scsictl  sends commands to the piscsi process to make configuration ad‐
       justments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

       Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both.

       You do NOT need root privileges to use scsictl. scsictl  also  runs  on
       non-Pi Linux platforms.

       Note:  The  command  and  type arguments are case insensitive. Only the
       first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.

       -i ID[:LUN]
              The  SCSI  ID  and  optional  LUN  that  you  want  to  control.
              (0-7:0-31)

       -c CMD Command is the operation being requested. Options are:
                 a(ttach): Attach disk
                 d(etach): Detach disk
                 i(nsert): Insert media (removable media devices only)
                 e(ject): Eject media (removable media devices only)
                 p(rotect):  Write  protect the medium (not for CD-ROMs, which
              are always read-only)
                 u(nprotect): Remove write protection from the medium (not for
              CD-ROMs, which are always read-only)
                 s(how): Display device information

              eject, protect and unprotect are idempotent.

       -b BLOCK_SIZE
              The  optional  block size, either 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes.
              The default size is 512 bytes.

       -f FILE|PARAM
              Device-specific: Either a path to a disk image file, or a param‐
              eter  for a non-disk device. See the piscsi(1) man page for per‐
              mitted file types.

       -t TYPE
              Specifies the device type. This type overrides the type  derived
              from  the  file  extension  of  the  specified  image.  See  the
              piscsi(1) man page for the  available  device  types.  For  some
              types there are shortcuts (only the first letter is required):
                 hd: SCSI hard disk drive
                 rm: SCSI removable media drive
                 cd: CD-ROM
                 mo: Magneto-Optical disk
                 lp: SCSI printer
                 bridge: Bridge device (Only applicable to the Sharp X68000)
                 daynaport: DaynaPort network adapter
                 services: Host services device

       -n VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
              The  vendor, product and revision for the device, to be returned
              with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be
              provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, REVISION up
              to 4 characters. Padding with blanks to the maxium length is au‐
              tomatically  applied.  Once  set  the name of a device cannot be
              changed.

       -u UNIT
              Unit number (0-31). This will default to 0. This option is  only
              used  when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI con‐
              troller. (This is not common)

EXAMPLES
       Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status.
          scsictl -l

       Example output:
          +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------
          | ID | LUN | TYPE | IMAGE FILE
          +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------
