       scsictl [-D | -e | -I | -l | -m | -N | -O | -o | -S | -T | -V | -v | -X]

DESCRIPTION
       scsictl sends commands to the piscsi process to make  configuration  ad‐
       justments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

       Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both.

       You  do  NOT  need  root privileges to use scsictl. scsictl also runs on
       non-Pi Linux platforms.

       Note: The command and type arguments  are  case  insensitive.  Only  the
       first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.

OPTIONS
       -b BLOCK_SIZE
               The  optional  block size, either 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes.
               The default size is 512 bytes.

       -C FILENAME:FILESIZE
               Create an image file in the default image folder with the speci‐
               fied name and size in bytes.

       -c CMD  Command is the operation being requested. Options are:
               •   a(ttach): Attach disk
               •   d(etach): Detach disk
               •   i(nsert): Insert media (removable media devices only)
               •   e(ject): Eject media (removable media devices only)
               •   p(rotect): Write protect the medium (not for CD-ROMs,  which
                   are always read-only)
               •   u(nprotect):  Remove  write  protection from the medium (not
                   for CD-ROMs, which are always read-only)
               •   s(how): Display device information

               eject, protect and unprotect are idempotent.

       -D      Detach all devices.

       -d FILENAME
               Delete an image file in the default image folder.

       -E FILENAME

       -f FILE|PARAM
               Device-specific: Either a path to a disk image file, or a  para‐
               meter for a non-disk device. See the piscsi(1) man page for per‐
               mitted file types.

       -I      Gets the list of reserved device IDs.

       -i ID[: LUN]
               The  SCSI  ID  and  optional  LUN  that  you  want  to  control.
               (0-7:0-31)

       -L LOG_LEVEL
               Set the piscsi log level (trace, debug,  info,  warning,  error,
               off).

       -l      List  all  of  the  devices that are currently being emulated by
               PiSCSI, as well as their current status.

       -h HOST
               The piscsi host to connect to, default is 'localhost'.

       -m      List all file extensions recognized by  PiSCSI  and  the  device
               types they map to.

       -N      Lists  all  available  network interfaces provided that they are
               up.

       -n VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
               The vendor, product and revision for the device, to be  returned
               with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be
               provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, REVISION up
               to 4 characters. Padding with blanks to the maxium length is au‐
               tomatically  applied.  Once  set  the name of a device cannot be
               changed.

       -O      Display the available piscsi server log levels and  the  current
               log level.

       -o      Display operation meta data information.

       -P      Prompt  for the access token in case piscsi requires authentica‐
               tion.

       -T      Display all device types and their properties.

       -t TYPE
               Specifies the device type. This type overrides the type  derived
               from  the  file  extension  of  the  specified  image.  See  the
               piscsi(1) man page for the available device type codes, or use a
               shorthand (only the first letter is required):
               •   cd: CD-ROM
               •   daynaport: DaynaPort Network Adapter

               Copy an image file in the default image folder.

       -z LOCALE
               Overrides the default locale for client-facing error messages.

       -u UNIT
               Unit number (0-31). This will default to 0. This option is  only
               used  when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI con‐
               troller. (This is not common)

EXAMPLES
       Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status.
             scsictl -l

       Example output:

             +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------
             | ID | LUN | TYPE | IMAGE FILE
             +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------
             |  0 |   1 | SCHD | /home/pi/harddisk.hda
             +----+-----+------+-------------------------------------

       Request the PiSCSI process to attach a disk (assumed) to SCSI ID 0  with
       the contents of the file system image "HDIIMAGE0.HDS".
             scsictl -i -0 -f -HDIIMAGE0.HDS
