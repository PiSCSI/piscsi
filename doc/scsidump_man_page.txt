NAME
       scsidump - SCSI disk dumping tool for PiSCSI

SYNOPSIS
       scsidump  -t  ID[:LUN] [-i BID] -f FILE [-s BUFFER_SIZE] [-r] [-v] [-p]
       [-I] ID[:LUN] [-S]

DESCRIPTION
       scsidump has two modes of operation: dump and  restore.  These  can  be
       used with physical storage media, including hard drives and magneto op‐
       tical drives. Dump mode can be used with read-only media such as CD/DVD
       drives.

       When  operating in dump mode, scsidump will copy all data from a remote
       SCSI drive to an image on the local filesystem.  If  enabled,  it  will
       also  generate a .properties file that can be used to more closely emu‐
       late the source drive.

       If you are operating in restore mode, scsidump will copy the data  from
       a  local  binary image to a remote physical SCSI drive. The remote SCSI
       drive MUST be writable.

NOTES
       scsidump requires either a direct connection (one without transceivers)
       or a FULLSPEC PiSCSI/RaSCSI board.

       If  the  generated  drive image is intended to be used with PiSCSI, the
       drive image should be moved by the user to ~/images  (or  the  location
       specified to the piscsi service).

OPTIONS
       -t ID[:LUN]
              SCSI  ID  and optional LUN of the remote SCSI device. The remote
              SCSI device will be functioning as the "Target" device.

       -i BID SCSI ID of the PiSCSI device. If not specified, the  PiSCSI  de‐
              vice  will  use ID 7. The PiSCSI host will be functioning as the
              "Initiator" device.

       -f FILE
              Path to the dump file.

       -s BUFFER_SIZE
              The transfer buffer size, specified in bytes. Default is 1  MiB.
              This  is  specified  in  bytes with a minimum value of 65536 (64
              KiB).

       -r     Run in restore mode. Defaults to dump mode if not specified.

       -v     Enable verbose logging.

       -p     Generate a .properties file that is compatible with  the  PiSCSI
              web interface. The output filename will match the image filename
              with ".properties" appended. The generated file should be  moved
              to ~/.config/piscsi.

       -I ID[:LUN]
              Display INQUIRY data of ID[:LUN].

       -S     Scan SCSI bus for devices.

EXAMPLES
       Dump  Mode:  [SCSI Drive] ---> [PiSCSI host] Launch scsidump to dump an
       all data from SCSI ID 3 with block size 64 KiB, store it to  the  local
       filesystem as a drive image named outimage.hda, and generate the outim‐
       age.hda.properties file with the drive's INQUIRY information:
          scsidump -t 3 -f ./outimage.hda -s 65536 -p

       Restore Mode: [PiSCSI host] ---> [SCSI Drive] Launch  scsidump  to  re‐
       store/upload a drive image from the local file system to SCSI ID 0 with
       block size 1MiB:
          scsidump -r -t 0 -f ./outimage.hda -s 1048576
