NAME
       scsidump - SCSI disk dumping tool for PiSCSI

SYNOPSIS
       scsidump -t ID[:LUN] [-i BID] -f FILE [-s BUFFER_SIZE] [-r] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       scsidump has two modes of operation: download and restore. These can be used with physical storage media, including hard drives and magneto optical drives. Download mode can be used with read-only media such as CD/DVD drives.

       When operating in download mode, scsidump will copy all data from a remote SCSI drive to an image on the local filesystem. Additionally, it will generate a .properties file that can be used to more closely emulate the source drive.

       If you are operating in restore mode, scsidump will copy the data from a local binary image to a remote physical SCSI drive. The remote SCSI drive MUST be writable.

       scsidump requires either a direct connection (one without transceivers) or a FULLSPEC PiSCSI/RaSCSI board.

OPTIONS
       -t ID[:LUN]
              SCSI ID and optional LUN of the remote SCSI device. The remote SCSI device will be functioning as the "Target" device.

       -i BID SCSI ID of the PiSCSI device. If not specified, the PiSCSI device will use ID 7. The PiSCSI host will be functioning as the "Initiator" device.

       -f FILE
              Path to the dump file.

       -s BUFFER_SIZE
              The transfer buffer size, specified in bytes. Default is 1 MiB. This is specified in bytes with a minimum value of 65536 (64 KiB).

       -r     Run in restore mode. Defaults to download mode if not specified.

       -v     Enable verbose logging.

EXAMPLES
       [SCSI Drive] ---> [PiSCSI host] Launch scsidump to download an all data from SCSI ID 3 and store it to the local filesystem as a drive image, with block size 64 KiB:
          scsidump -t 3 -f ./outimage.hda -s 65536

       [PiSCSI host] ---> [SCSI Drive] Launch scsidump to restore/upload a drive image from the local file system to SCSI ID 0 with block size 1MiB:
          scsidump -r -t 0 -f ./outimage.hda -s 1048576
