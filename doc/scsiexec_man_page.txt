NAME
       scsiexec - SCSI command execution tool for PiSCSI

SYNOPSIS
       scsiexec  -t  ID[:LUN]  [-i  BID] -f FILENAME [-b] [-F] [-B] [-T] [-tR]
       ID[:LUN] [-L LOG_LEVEL] [-X]

DESCRIPTION
       scsiexec wraps protobuf input data into a custom PiSCSI  SCSI  command,
       has piscsi execute it and display the results. The input data must be a
       legal  command  for  the  PiSCSi  protobuf  interface.  See  the   file
       piscsi_interface.proto for details.

NOTES
       scsiexec  helps with advanced testing. It requires two connected PiSCSI
       boards. The board scsiexec is running on must be a FULLSPEC  board  be‐
       cause scsiexec requires SCSI initiator mode support.

OPTIONS
       -t ID[:LUN]
              SCSI  ID and optional LUN of the second PiSCSI board. The remote
              SCSI device will be functioning as the "Target" device.

       -i BID SCSI ID of the PiSCSI device. If not specified, the  PiSCSI  de‐
              vice  will  use ID 7. The PiSCSI host will be functioning as the
              "Initiator" device.

       -f FILE
              The protobuf data input file, by default in JSON format.

       -b     Signals that the input file is in protobuf binary format.

       -F     Signals that the input file is in protobuf text format.

       -B     Generate a protobuf binary format file.

       -T     Generate a protobuf text format file.

       -L LOG_LEVEL
              Set the log level (trace, debug, info, warning, error, off). The
              default log level is 'info'.

       -X     Shut down piscsi with a SCSI command.
