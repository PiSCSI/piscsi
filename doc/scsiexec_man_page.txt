NAME
       scsidump - SCSI action execution tool for PiSCSI

SYNOPSIS
       scsidump  -t  ID[:LUN]  [-i  BID]  -f  FILENAME [-b] [-tR] ID[:LUN] [-L
       LOG_LEVEL]

DESCRIPTION
       scsiexec wraps JSON or binary input data in protobuf format into a cus‐
       tom  PiSCSI SCSI command, has piscsi execute it and display the results
       in JSON format. The input data must be legal commands  for  the  PiSCSi
       protobuf  interface.  See  the file piscsi_interface.proto for details.
       scsiexec helps with advanced testing. It requires two connected  PiSCSI
       boards.

NOTES
       scsidump requires either a direct connection (one without transceivers)
       or a FULLSPEC PiSCSI/RaSCSI board.

OPTIONS
       -t ID[:LUN]
              SCSI ID and optional LUN of the remote SCSI device.  The  remote
              SCSI device will be functioning as the "Target" device.

       -i BID SCSI  ID  of the PiSCSI device. If not specified, the PiSCSI de‐
              vice will use ID 7. The PiSCSI host will be functioning  as  the
              "Initiator" device.

       -f FILE
              Path to the input file with JSON or binary protobuf data.

       -b     Signals  that  the  inout  file  is a binary file and not a JSON
              file.

       -L LOG_LEVEL
              The scsiexec log level  (trace,  debug,  info,  warning,  error,
              off). The default log level is 'info'.
