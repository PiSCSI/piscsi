DESCRIPTION
       piscsi emulates SCSI devices using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

       In the arguments to PiSCSI, one or more SCSI (-IDn[:u]) devices  can  be
       specified.   The  number (n) after the ID or HD identifier specifies the
       ID number for that device. The optional number  (u)  specifies  the  LUN
       (logical  unit) for that device. The default LUN is 0.  For SCSI: The ID
       is limited from 0-7. However, typically SCSI ID 7 is  reserved  for  the
       "initiator" (the host computer). The LUN is limited from 0-31.

       PiSCSI  will  determine the type of device based upon the file extension
       of the FILE argument.
           hds: Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable)
           hd1: Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable,  SCSI-1  compatibility
       mode)
           hdr: Hard Disk image (generic, removable)
           hdn:  Hard Disk image (NEC compatible - only used with PC-98 comput‐
       ers)
           hdi: Hard Disk image (Anex86 proprietary - only used with PC-98 com‐
       puters)
           nhd: Hard Disk image (T98Next proprietary -  only  used  with  PC-98
       computers)
           hda:  Hard Disk image (Apple compatible - typically used with Macin‐
       tosh computers)
           mos: Magneto-Optical image (generic  -  typically  used  with  NeXT,
       X68000, etc.)
           iso: CD-ROM or DVD-ROM image (ISO 9660 image)
           is1:  CD-ROM  or DVD-ROM image (ISO 9660 image, SCSI-1 compatibility
       mode)
           tap: Tape image (raw tape image containing non-block data)
           tar: Tape archive (tape block data in tar format)

       If the file extension is not recognized, the device type can  be  speci‐
       fied explicitly using the -t option and a four letter code.
           SCCD: SCSI CD-ROM (generic CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive)
           SCDP: SCSI DaynaPort (DaynaPort compatible network adapter)
           SCHD: SCSI Hard Disk (generic, non-removable)
           SCHS: SCSI Host Services (used for special host services)
           SCLP: SCSI Printer (generic line printer)
           SCMO: SCSI Magneto-Optical Drive (generic MO drive)
           SCRM: SCSI Removable Hard Disk (generic, removable)
           SCTP: SCSI Tape Drive (generic tape, or streamer, drive)

       For  example,  if you want to specify an Apple-compatible HD image on ID
       0, you can use the following command:
           sudo piscsi -ID0 /path/to/drive/hdimage.hda

       Note: PiSCSI is a fork of RaSCSI. The two cannot be run in  parallel  on
       the same system.

       Once  PiSCSI starts, it will open a socket (default port is 6868) to al‐
       low external management commands.  If  another  process  is  using  this
       port,  PiSCSI  will  terminate,  since  it is likely another instance of
       PiSCSI or RaSCSI.  Once PiSCSI has initialized, the scsictl utility  can
       be used to send commands.

       To  quit  PiSCSI, press Control + C. If it is running in the background,
       you can kill it using an INT signal.

OPTIONS
       -b BLOCK_SIZE
               The optional block size, either 512, 1024, 2048 or  4096  bytes.
               Default size is 512 bytes.

       -F FOLDER
               The  default folder for image files. For files in this folder no
               absolute path needs to be specified. The initial default  folder
               is '~/images'.

       -h      Show a help page.

       -L LOG_LEVEL[: ID[: LUN]]
               The  piscsi log level (trace, debug, info, warning, error, off).
               The default log level is 'info' for all devices unless a partic‐
               ular device ID and an optional LUN was provided.

       -n VENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
               Set the vendor, product and revision for the device, to  be  re‐
               turned  with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components
               must be provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, RE‐
               VISION up to 4 characters. Padding with  blanks  to  the  maxium
               length  is  automatically applied. Once set the name of a device
               cannot be changed.

       -P ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE
               Enable authentication and read the access token from the  speci‐
               fied  file. The access token file must be owned by root and must
               be readable by root only.

       -p PORT
               The piscsi server port, default is 6868.

       -R SCAN_DEPTH
               Scan for image files recursively, up to a depth  of  SCAN_DEPTH.
               Depth  0  means  to  ignore any folders within the default image
               folder. Be careful when using this option with many  sub-folders
               in the default image folder. The default depth is 1.

       -r RESERVED_IDS
               Comma-separated  list  of  IDs to reserve. Pass an empty list in
               order to not reserve anything.

       -s MICROSECONDS
               Minimum execution time for SCSI commands  in  microseconds.  De‐
               fault  is  50.  Higher  values may be needed for some older SCSI
               initiators to work properly.

       -t TYPE
               The optional case-insensitive device  type  (see  list  of  type
               codes  above).  If no type is specified for devices that support
               an image file, piscsi tries to derive the type from the file ex‐
               tension.

       -v      Display the piscsi version.

       -z LOCALE
               Sets the default locale for client-facing  error  messages.  The
               client can override the locale.

       -ID n[: u] FILE
               n  is  the  SCSI  ID  number (0-7). u (0-31) is the optional LUN
               (logical unit). The default LUN is 0.

               FILE is the name of the image file to use for a SCSI mass  stor‐
               age device. For devices that do not support an image file (SCDP,
               SCLP,  SCHS)  the filename may have a special meaning or a dummy
               name can be provided. For SCDP it is a prioritized list of  net‐
               work  interfaces  with  an  IP address and netmask, e.g. "inter‐
               face=eth0,eth1,wlan0:inet=10.10.20.1/24". For  SCLP  it  is  the
               print  command  to be used and a reservation timeout in seconds,
               e.g. "cmd=lp -oraw %f:timeout=60".

EXAMPLES
       Launch PiSCSI with no emulated drives attached:
             piscsi

       Launch PiSCSI with an Apple hard drive image as ID 0 and a CD-ROM as  ID
       2
             piscsi -ID0 /path/to/harddrive.hda -ID2 /path/to/cdimage.iso

       Launch  PiSCSI with a removable SCSI drive image as ID 0 and the raw de‐
       vice file /dev/hdb (e.g. a USB stick) and a DaynaPort network adapter as
       ID 6:
             piscsi -ID0 -t scrm /dev/hdb -ID6 -t scdp daynaport

       To create an empty, 100MiB HD image, use the following command:
             dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/newimage.hda bs=512 count=204800

       In case the fallocate command is available a much faster alternative  to
       the dd command is:
             fallocate -l 104857600 /path/to/newimage.hda
