.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rasctl
Sends commands to the rascsi process to make configuration adjustments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both. 

You do NOT need root privileges to use rasctl.

Note: The command and type arguments are case insensitive. Only the first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.
