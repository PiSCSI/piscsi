.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rasctl
Sends commands to the rascsi process to make configuration adjustments at runtime or to check the status of the devices.

Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both. 

You do NOT need root privileges to use rasctl.

Note: The command and type arguments are case insensitive. Only the first letter of the command/type is evaluated by the tool.

.BR \-r\fI " " \fIRESERVED_IDS
Comma-separated list of IDs to reserve.
.TP
.BR \-s\fI
Display server-side settings like available images or supported device types.
.TP

.TP
.BR \-i\fI " " \fIID
ID is the SCSI ID that you want to control. (0-7)
.TP 
.BR \-c\fI " " \fICMD
Command is the operation being requested. Options are:
   a(ttach): Attach disk
   d(etach): Detach disk
   i(nsert): Insert media (removable media devices only)
   e(ject): Eject media (removable media devices only)
   p(rotect): Write protect the medium (not for CD-ROMs, which are always read-only)
   u(nprotect): Remove write protection from the medium (not for CD-ROMs, which are always read-only)
   s(how): Display device information
.IP
eject, protect and unprotect are idempotent.
.TP 
.BR \-b\fI " " \fIBLOCK_SIZE
The optional block size. For SCSI drives 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes, default size is 512 bytes. For SASI drives 256 or 1024 bytes, default is 256 bytes.
.TP
.BR \-f\fI " " \fIFILE|PARAM
Device-specific: Either a path to a disk image file, or a parameter for a non-disk device. See the rascsi(1) man page for permitted file types.
.TP 
.BR \-t\fI " " \fITYPE
Specifies the device type. This type overrides the type derived from the file extension of the specified image. See the rascsi(1) man page for the available device types. For some types there are shortcuts (only the first letter is required):
   hd: SCSI hard disk drive
   rm: SCSI removable media drive
   cd: CD-ROM
   mo: Magneto-Optical disk
   bridge: Bridge device (Only applicable to the Sharp X68000)
   daynaport: DaynaPORT network adapter
.TP 
.BR \-n\fI " " \fIVENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
The vendor, product and revision for the device, to be returned with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, REVISION up to 4 characters. Padding with blanks to the maxium length is automatically applied. Once set the name of a device cannot be changed.
.TP 
.BR \-u\fI " " \fIUNIT
Unit number (0 or 1). This will default to 0. This option is only used when there are multiple SCSI devices on a shared SCSI controller. (This is not common)

.SH EXAMPLES
Show a listing of all of the SCSI devices and their current status.
   rasctl -l


Example output:
   +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
   | ID | UN | TYPE | DEVICE STATUS
   +----+----+------+-------------------------------------
   |  0 |  1 | SCHD | /home/pi/harddisk.hda
   +----+----+------+-------------------------------------

Request the RaSCSI process to attach a disk (assumed) to SCSI ID 0 with the contents of the file system image "HDIIMAGE0.HDS".
