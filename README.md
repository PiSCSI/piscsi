# What is RaSCSI?
RaSCSI is a virtual SCSI device emulator that runs on a Raspberry Pi. It runs in userspace, and can emulate several SCSI devices at one time. There is a control interface to attach / detach drives during runtime, as well as insert and eject removable media. This project is aimed at users of vintage Macintosh and Atari computers and more (see [compatibility list](https://github.com/akuker/RASCSI/wiki/Compatibility)) from the 1980's and 1990's.

Please check out the full story with much more detail on the [wiki](https://github.com/akuker/RASCSI/wiki)!

# How do I contribute?
RaSCSI is using the <a href="https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html">Gitflow Workflow</a>. A quick overview:

- The *master* branch should always reflect the contents of the last stable release
- The *develop* branch should contain the latest tested & approved updates. Pull requests should be used to merge changes into develop.
- The rest of the feature branches are for developing new features
- A tag will be created for each "release". The releases will be named <year>.<month> (for the first release of the month). Hot fixes, if necessary, will be released as <year>.<month>.<release number>. For example, the first release in January 2021 will be release "21.01". If a hot-fix is needed for this release, the first hotfix will be "21.01.1".
  
Typically, releases will only be planned every few months.
