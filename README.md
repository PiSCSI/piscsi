# What is RaSCSI Reloaded?
RaSCSI Reloaded is a virtual SCSI device emulator that runs on a Raspberry Pi. It runs in userspace, and can emulate several SCSI devices at one time. There is a control interface to attach / detach drives during runtime, as well as insert and eject removable media. This project is aimed at users of vintage Macintosh and Atari computers and more (see [compatibility list](https://github.com/akuker/RASCSI/wiki/Compatibility)) from the 1980's and 1990's.

# How do I contribute?
RaSCSI Reloaded is using the <a href="https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html">Gitflow Workflow</a>. A quick overview:

- The *master* branch should always reflect the contents of the last stable release
- The *develop* branch should contain the latest tested & approved updates. Pull requests should be used to merge changes into develop.
- The rest of the feature branches are for developing new features
- A tag will be created for each "release". The releases will be named <year>.<month>.<release number> where the release number is incremented for each subsequent release tagged in the same calendar month. The first release of the month of January 2021 is called "21.01.01", the second one in the same month "21.01.02 and so on.
  
Typically, releases will only be planned every few months.
